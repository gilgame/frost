# Frost Library

This repo contains programs that I find useful on a day to day basis as a programmer and analyst. I started these projects as an educational experience to familiarize myself with C# 8 and the .Net Core. While other, more robust, options exist, I find that they over exceed my requirements. I'm publishing them here in the event that anyone else might find them useful.
